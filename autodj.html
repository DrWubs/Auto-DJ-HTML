This script allows you to automatically get on stage without the need of clicking "Play Music"

<h2>Read Before Continuing:</h2>
<p>
Auto DJ will not work if you have any extensions that effect the normal function or interface of Turntable.fm including the extension Turntable X  for Google Chrome. Auto DJ will not have the ability to be manually turned off if both Auto DJ and Auto Awesome are on at the same time, but both will still work at their normal function. Auto DJ is not allowed in most rooms on TT.fm. Users should check the rules of the room, or check with a Moderator of the room for permission before using Auto DJ. I (Dr. Wubs) am not responsible for any acts taken by room creators and/or moderators for the result of you using Auto DJ.  
</p>

<h2>Disclaimer:</h2>
Auto DJ does not guarantee you a spot on stage. The quality of your internet speed also plays a factor in how fast the script reacts to an open spot on stage, which may allow other users to get on stage before you.
